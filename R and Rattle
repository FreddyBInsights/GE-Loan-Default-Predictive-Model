General Electric Loan Default Predictive Model


# Data Understanding and Preparation

# Load readxl package to R library to allow R to read the Credit Data excel document

library(readxl)

# Run the code below to import the Credit Data into the R environment 

# Ensure that the code reflects the location of the Credit Data file on your computer

Creditdata <- read_excel("//apporto.com/dfs/SNHU/Users/alfred.bascom_snhu/Desktop/GE/DAT 690 Credit-Proj1LoanDfltTrain.xlsx")

# View the data

view(Creditdata) # Provides a look at the raw data

str(Creditdata) # Provides further details about the data

# Install and open rattle

install.packages("rattle") # Installs the rattle package 
library(rattle) # Add rattle to the R library 
rattle() # Open rattle


# While in rattle
# 1. On Data tab select R Dataset and choose the file Creditdata (Execute)
# 2. Select partition and set to 70/30
# 3. Seed: 42
# 4. Set variable OBS. to Ident
# 5. Ensure DEFAULT is set as the Target variable

# Summarize the data

summary(Creditdata) # Provides a summary of the Credit Data

# Describe the data

library(Hmisc) # Add the Hmisc package to the R library

describe(Creditdata) # Provides a description of the data 

# Check for missing data 

is.na(Creditdata) # Provides details about missing data

na.omit(Creditdata) # Allows you to remove incomplete rows of data

# Check distribution

plot(ecdf(Creditdata$DURATION)) # Modify the code to produce distribution visualization for the variable you want

# Alternative way to check distribution
# Go to the Explore tab in rattle and select Distribution
# Select a variable and the type of visualization (Execute)

# Check for correlation between independent variables 

install.packages("corrplot") # install corrplot package
library("corrplot") # Add the corrplot package to the R library 

corrplot(cor(Creditdata), method = "number") #Produces a correlation visualization

# Remove highly correlated independent variables

# Before building model:
# 1. Ensure data understanding and preparation have been complete
# 2. Ensure that data has been partitioned into training and test sets

# Build a logistic regression model

Model <- glm(formula = DEFAULT ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"),data = crs$dataset[crs$train, c(crs$input, crs$target)])

# Model evaluation 

summary(Model) # Model summary

# The information within the summary should be used to omit insignificant variables

eval(Model) # Provides a better look at each variables estimate

plot(Model) # Produces visualizations of the model    

# On the Data tab in rattle change insignificant variables from input to ignore (Execute)
# Complete iterations of variable reduction and model building

# Revisit data understanding and preparation steps if necessary
 
# Save the model after each iteration

saveRDS(Model, "./Model.RDS") # Ensure the model's name is reflected in the code

# Open the model

GEModel <- readRDS("./Model.RDS") # Ensure the model's name is reflected in the code
