Development of a predictive analytic program which identifies key loan default indicators and whether a customer is likely to default on their loan.

CRISP-DM:
This project followed the widely used data mining process model known as CRISP-DM. CRIPS-DM is a six-phase iterative process model which includes the phases business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

Business problem:
General Electric’s Credit Union has experienced three major problems:
(1) The credit union noticed an alarming number of loanees defaulting on their loans. (2) As a result of this loan default increase, the organization incurred major credit losses at a rate of 150% for each of the remaining loan balances. (3) A deeper look at these problems revealed that credit union credit team was utilizing less than effective applicant assessment procedures.

Business goals and objectives:
Taking the business problem into consideration GE requested the development of a full-enterprise predictive analytic model.
(1)GE wants to identify the leading drivers for loan defaults and to improve the credit union’s credit team’s applicant assessment effectiveness.

Compiled dataset:
GE's IT department compiled a dataset with past credit applicant data to train the predictive model and to evaluate/verify the performance of the predictive model.

Proposed solution:
Develop a predictive model which classifies a applicant as a credit risk (will default on loan) or not a credit risk (will not default on loan)

Software:
(1) Excel, (2) R, (3) Rattle

Data understanding/preparation techniques:
(1) Data summaries, (2) Correlation reports, (3) Distribution charts, (4) Missing data summaries

Model building techniques:
Classification model: Logistic Regression model

Evaluation techniques:
(1) Error matrix, (2) Risk chart, (3) Area under the ROC

Scoring (Verification): 
(1) Probability, (2) Score
